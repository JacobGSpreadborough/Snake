Training a neural network to play a version of 'Snake' that I built from scratch
Uses the position of the snake's cells and one food cell to calculate its next move.
Cells in the game's grid are labelled with -1 for body cell, 1 for food, and 0 for empty
Neural network code is adapted from code used to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset
